This target is for the LINAC Locking project.  The board receives both NC and
SC timing.  It generates hard-coded triggers for
  0-3 : 71kHz SC trigger
  4   : 360Hz AC SC trigger
  5   : 60Hz TS1 SC trigger
  6   : 1Hz TS1 SC trigger
  7   : 360Hz AC NC trigger
  8   : 60Hz TS1 NC trigger
  9   : 1Hz TS1 NC trigger
The board measures the relative time difference between the 360Hz NC fiducial
and the next 71kHz SC rate marker.  This is used for initial alignment and
bucket jump monitoring in the locked timing systems.
